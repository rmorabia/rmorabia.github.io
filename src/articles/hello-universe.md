## Welcome to Electroniq

*Electroniq* is a new blog about space, distant galaxies and black holes.

We'll talk about [the holographic principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holographic_principle), dark matter and the beauty of space in infrared light.

This blog is run by **Tara** and **Elias**.
