# Hire Me

## For recruiters:

**Roles I would match:** Senior Software Engineer, Senior Product Engineer, Senior Full-Stack Engineer, Senior Front-End Engineer

**Industries I am interested in:** MedTech, HealthTech, BioTech, Life Sciences

**Skills:** React, TypeScript, Node.js, Python, Java / C#, MongoDB, SQL

**Years of Experience:** 7

**Size of company:** I am open to anything from 3 engineers to 1000+. I am never going to be a matching fit for a pre-seed founding engineer! I am likely the best fit for a Series B or Series C startup.

**Location:** San Francisco Bay Area, open to NYC and LA. Strongly prefer the office to not be in South Bay, but I'll compromise for the right place and a hybrid work environment.

**In-office?:** Yep! My preference is to be in an office 4 days a week, but I am open to 5.

**Open to remote?:** You can probably find someone who's way more invested in that kind of set-up. Let's be honest, you're only looking at me because I'm based in SF.

**Actively interviewing?** No, I'm only open to the right opportunity.

**Visa Status:** I'm a U.S. citizen. I don't have security clearance, though.

**RESUME:** [Here's a link.](https://rmorabia.com/resume)

**TO GET A REPLY:** I promise you I will get on a call with you if you include the word stardust somewhere in your email or LinkedIn message. My email is hi@[thisdomain].com.

## For hiring managers:

I genuinely don't know if any hirng managers will ever read this, but if you are, thank you! Here's a more honest assessment of the above:

I have been working in restaurant tech for a long time, but whenever I part ways with my current company, I will only be looking for roles in medical / health / bio / science. I am _extremely_ passionate about this switch and will outpace anyone who's just looking for a job in general.

### What skills do I really offer? What's the ramp up time?

**Hit the ground running:**

* React
* TypeScript
* Node.js

**Need a week or two to get some momentum again:**

* Any other front-end framework (Next.js, Vue, Svelte)
* Python / Java / C#
* MongoDB
* LLM-based development

**Can't be trusted as the primary engineer, but very open to learn:**

* SQL and Databases
* AWS / GCP
* Computer Vision / any other AI (not LLMs)
* Most anything else you throw at me

**If you put me on this, I will complain and probably loudly:**

* Kubernetes (or really, anything to do with infra management)

### What makes me stand out? Why should you want me on your team?

* I routinely become a go-to person for the codebases I join within 6 months.
* I question decisions at all levels -- from PRDs to tech designs to code reviews.
* I excel in greenfield projects with small-teams. Build a new flow within a month with 3 total engineers? Consider it done.
* I can build things end-to-end (but, you probably don't want me handling the infra).
* I _care_.
* Maintainability and readability are core priorities.
* I get better every day.
* I leave things better than I find them.
* I don't care about tech for the sake of tech. It's always about the product, users, and our future selves.
* I read the code. I read the docs.
* I actively spend time trying to learn the fundamentals. The tools themselves are easy to pick up and put down.

### What are my values for a good engineering environment and company?

* Strong opinions, loosely held.
* Product engineers (full-stack) are the best way to move fast and gain a competitive advantage.
* Pairing and code reviews are awesome.
* We're probably not as special as we think we are -- I bias towards the most popular tool.

### What have I been working on?

Unfortunately, I am unable to show you any direct code right now. I am part of a small front-end team building and maintaining the internal admin dashboard for 60k+ restaurants. [Here's a video I found from 8 years ago(!?) before I was on this team showing the product I'm working on.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4k_f8ZaFgc) A lot has changed since, but you get the idea.

Note that I am also learning on the side, so I'll update this if I end up making some nice side projects someday. Right now, I am working through [teaching myself CS](https://teachyourselfcs.com), so most of that isn't super impressive to show off.

My only advice to you is to read this blog. You can see that I care and I'm working on improving myself as an engineer every day.

## How should you get in touch?

If you've actually gotten this far, I am in awe. You're awesome and we should talk. Send an email to hi@[thisdomain].com and be sure to include **stardust** in the email somewhere so I know you've actually read this.

This says more about me than my resume, but if you still need that internally, [here's a link](https://rmorabia.com/resume).
