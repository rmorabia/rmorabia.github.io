I've been keeping a daily practice of watching one talk during work, usually during lunch break, because I believe they are the best way for corporate-focused engineers to learn new things now. Blogs are too cutting edge, and books are too bloated to allow for a variety of inputs. Talks let me learn things in a low stakes way even from disciplines I'm not necessarily a part of.

[Tech Talks Weekly](https://techtalksweekly.substack.com) is how I get all my talks, by the way. Every week, they send a list of basically every talk that went live that week. I add them to my YouTube Watch Later. Then, I shuffle during work and usually watch on a slightly faster speed. If 10ish minutes have passed and there's no build up to anything seemingly useful or interesting (lots of infotainment out there), I move on.

Here are the talks that I've found very good and interesting thus far. Keep in mind this is heavily filtered! This will also be updated to whatever date the published date says.

* [Bun, Deno, Node.js? Recreating a JavaScript runtime from Scratch - Erick Wendel - NDC Oslo 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNGDW3snVyA)

Pretty good talk that goes over Node internals. How does it work? What's it actually doing?

* [How to fall in love with TDD - Gui Ferreira - NDC Oslo 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXnTMjMe5Eg)

Finally made me *get* TDD. I'm going to try it based on notes for this talk, actually.

* [The Past, Present, and Future of Cross-Site/Cross-Origin Request Forgery - Philippe De Ryck](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZimlztLa1g)

Finally made me get CORS. More interesting than useful for my work.
