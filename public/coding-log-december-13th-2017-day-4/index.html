<p><strong>Here&#39;s what I did today:</strong></p>
<h2 id="continued-to-learn-the-command-line">Continued to Learn the Command Line</h2>
<p>I took a day off yesterday. I came back and suddenly this tutorial is trying to teach me vi(m). No, thank you. At this point, the tutorial is becoming too advanced for my own needs. I don&#39;t really need to learn vi(m) or bash scripting or efficiency practices. Not yet, at least. I&#39;m still skimming through it and trying some of it out, but most of it is flying well over my head for lack of use.</p>
<p>The second half of <a href="https://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial">this tutorial</a> got a lot heavier than the first. I am still not done. I&#39;ve learned a lot, though, and will be posting all of my incoherent notes once I am actually finished with the book.</p>
<h2 id="tomorrow-s-to-do-s">Tomorrow&#39;s To-Do&#39;s</h2>
<p>FINISH THIS COURSE!</p>
