      <p><strong>Coding Time:</strong> Half Day</p>
<p><strong>Here&#39;s what I did today:</strong></p>
<h2 id="-i-finished-the-fourth-thing-http-rmorabia-com-tinyjs-"><a href="http://rmorabia.com/tinyjs">I Finished The Fourth Thing</a></h2>
<p>I was really dreading debugging the last two requirements of this project. I dont know why.</p>
<p>I read a rule recently -- Every day, tell yourself you only need to code for 1 minute. Chances are, once you get past that minute, you&#39;ll want to keep going. It&#39;s a good rule that would&#39;ve helped me today. Just get started and the fun of the challenge kept me going.</p>
<p>I added a lot of programming knowledge to the requirement that said to stop the numbers from going up once someone is declared a winner (by going green). I tried something and got bugs, I tried re-ordering and got other bugs. So, it&#39;s kind of a 70-line mess. In the end, I got it to work, though. That&#39;s what matters most.</p>
<p>Requirement #6, which was to update the &quot;Playing To&quot; without needing to click a button was very easy. One Google search, one MDN check (it&#39;s starting to grow on me), and two event listeners for <code>click</code> and <code>keyup</code>.</p>
<p>The biggest difference between this project and the project on Day 2 was that I made this bug-proof. I checked every possible outcome. There was a weird bug for a while where (assuming your Playing To is set to 5), if one player reached 4 and the other was still at 0, you couldn&#39;t increase that 0 to 1. If it was 4-3, it could be 4-4. It was only at 4-0 or 0-4. And, I had to walk through that programming logic to figure out why that was happening, what did I do that said that was the action the code is supposed to take?</p>
<p>And that debugging is what made the code really long. I spent a lot of extra time just trying to check every single possibility.</p>
<p>But, I did it. I&#39;m forcing myself to watch the 30 minute tutorial in the Web Developer Bootcamp I was supposed to code along with instead of coding from scratch. I&#39;m sure Colt will make it deceptively easy.</p>
<p>Also, I&#39;d like to acknowledge that there is no way I could code this project from scratch without <a href="http://watchandcode.com">Practical JavaScript</a>. I&#39;ve seen the way The Web Developer Bootcamp handles projects, and it&#39;s complicated. It&#39;s not iterative like PJ shows. Breaking down a project into requirements and steps is such a helpful concept I didn&#39;t really think about when going through Practical JavaScript. I&#39;m glad I did before I went through the Bootcamp. That process seems to be priceless.</p>
<p>Double also, GitHub Pages updates very slowly and my new testing ground for deploying projects live is Glitch. If something isn&#39;t working in the main link, double check with <a href="http://rmorabia.glitch.me">rmorabia.glitch.me</a>. </p>
<p><strong>Thoughts after seeing Colt&#39;s code:</strong> Welp. Totally different thought process on how to approach the problem. My code is 66 lines, his is 53 lines. It&#39;s a negligible difference.</p>
<p>There&#39;s only two things I want to change about my code after that.</p>
<p>I didn&#39;t use the best event listener for the input value. I had two -- <code>click</code> and <code>keyup</code>. I can combine that into one called <code>change</code>.</p>
<p>I also didn&#39;t reset the scores each time the playing to value changed. Whoops. One bug I missed testing for. </p>
<p>I really don&#39;t like tutorials &amp; code-alongs, especially after seeing Practical JavaScript. They just take you through the &quot;logical&quot; route, which isn&#39;t the correct route. It isn&#39;t the route that you&#39;d get if you tried it on your own. It&#39;s so much more zig-zaggy on your own. I really don&#39;t want to have to go through any more tutorials and code alongs for JavaScript.</p>
<p>I want the info, I want a few examples of how to apply it, and then I just want ideas for projects that I can break down on my own.</p>
<h2 id="continued-watching-the-web-developer-bootcamp-http-udemy-com-the-web-developer-bootcamp-">Continued watching <a href="http://udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp">The Web Developer Bootcamp</a></h2>
<p>It&#39;s really hard to focus when I already know something or I mentally feel finished with something. I watched the code along for the score keeper project on 2x speed and it was still slow and boring.</p>
<p>After a few more exercises, we have 2 huge projects in a row that each take up their own section. I don&#39;t know if I can do that all on my own or if I have to code-along. I really don&#39;t want to do another code-along with vanilla JavaScript.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s the map again: </p>
<ul>
<li>[X] Introduction to this Course 7/7</li>
<li>[X] Introduction to Front End Development 4/4</li>
<li><del>Introduction to HTML 5/13</del></li>
<li><del>Intermediate HTML 0/13</del></li>
<li><del>Introduction to CSS 0/13</del></li>
<li><del>Intermediate CSS 0/16</del></li>
<li><del>Bootstrap 0/15</del></li>
<li>[ ] Introduction to JavaScript 0/12</li>
<li>[ ] Javascript Basics: Control Flow 0/17</li>
<li>[ ] Javascript Basics: Functions 0/10</li>
<li>[ ] Javascript Basics: Arrays 0/12</li>
<li>[ ] Javascript Basics: Objects 0/7</li>
<li>[X] DOM Manipulation 13/13</li>
<li>[X] Advanced DOM Manipulation 8/8</li>
<li>[ ] Color Game Project 0/10</li>
<li><del>Intro to jQuery 0/9</del></li>
<li><del>Advanced jQuery 0/5</del></li>
<li>[ ] Todo List Projects 0/11</li>
<li>[ ] Project: Patatap Clone 0 / 9</li>
</ul>
<p>So, I&#39;m done with all the DOM manipulation sections. I&#39;m going to be starting &amp; completing all 3 of the projects as soon as I can. If it gets too hard or I just get bored, I&#39;ll go back to JavaScript Basics. </p>
<h2 id="tomorrow-s-to-do-s">Tomorrow&#39;s To-Do&#39;s</h2>
<p>Start the Color Game Project tomorrow.</p>
<p>Possibly build another small component like a carousel or an accordian.</p>
<p>If I have extra time, I want to try reading Books #1 and #2 (or the equivalent video courses) of You Don&#39;t Know JS again. </p>
