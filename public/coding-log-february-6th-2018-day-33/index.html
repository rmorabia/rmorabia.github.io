      <p><strong>Coding Time:</strong> Full Day</p>
<p><strong>Here&#39;s what I did today:</strong></p>
<h2 id="nearly-finished-building-my-todo-list-http-rmorabia-com-todo-">Nearly Finished Building my <a href="http://rmorabia.com/todo">Todo List</a></h2>
<p>In some ways, this was the easiest project I&#39;ve done to date. In other ways, it&#39;s the hardest. I don&#39;t know. I have very mixed feelings about it. </p>
<p>All but 2 of the requirements are done:</p>
<ol>
<li>There&#39;s a bug when clicking the delete button span sometimes.</li>
<li>I want to add a feature where the corresponding delete button only shows up when you hover over the element you want to delete.</li>
</ol>
<p>This project constitutes the most time I&#39;ve had to ask for help and the cleanest/easiest code I&#39;ve ever written. I don&#39;t know. It&#39;s complicated.</p>
<h2 id="tomorrow-s-to-do-s">Tomorrow&#39;s To-Do&#39;s</h2>
<p>Finish this app. </p>
<p>Start JavaScrip30.</p>
<p>If time, move on to theory learning in some way again. </p>
