      <p><strong>Coding Time:</strong> Full Day</p>
<p><strong>Here&#39;s what I did today:</strong></p>
<h2 id="continued-freecodecamp-s-basic-javascript-track-http-freecodecamp-org-">Continued <a href="http://freecodecamp.org">FreeCodeCamp&#39;s Basic JavaScript Track</a></h2>
<p>I didn&#39;t do a lot of this today. I had some major procrastination come over me. It&#39;s one thing to get distracted, it&#39;s a whole other thing to actively want to do something else.</p>
<p>Why? Because FreeCodeCamp&#39;s Basic JavaScript course is teaching me nothing. I know all of it, but at the same time, I&#39;m really not a fan of this type of in-browser code manipulation. For the parts of the code that I didn&#39;t understand, it was just about editing the text to get it right. If this was the only resource I was following, I would easily forget the syntax for pushing arrays and making functions.</p>
<p>So, I&#39;m going to stop. </p>
<h2 id="continued-trying-to-zero-in-on-a-path">Continued Trying to Zero In on a Path</h2>
<p>I know I keep going back and forth with this. I&#39;ve spent more time trying to bridge that gap between basic and intermediate JS than actually learning JS itself. I know.</p>
<p>However, I think there&#39;s a lot to be said about taking the time to choose the right path. Especially after the experience from jumping from YDKJS to Watch &amp; Code — I want to do something that feels right. I <em>only</em> want to do things that feel right. Even if that means I spend more time thinking about what to do than actually doing it.</p>
<p>I truly believe that once I overcome this hurdle, I will be unstoppable. Once you can build something, anything, using a dynamic programming language, it&#39;s only a matter of time before you build a full-scale app on your own.</p>
<p>I did a lot more reading &amp; thinking today. I read <a href="https://zellwk.com/blog/how-to-learn-javascript/">one article in particular</a> that really hit the nail on the head. </p>
<p>Basically, there are 4 stages to learning JavaScript. </p>
<ul>
<li>Stage 1: Learning Syntax</li>
<li>Stage 2: Building Your First Thing</li>
<li>Stage 3: You can Build Anything... With Time.</li>
<li>Stage 4: You can <em>Actually</em> Build Anything</li>
</ul>
<p>I suggest you read the whole article. </p>
<p><strong>Sidenote:</strong> I said &quot;thing&quot; in Stage 2 on purpose. Saying &quot;Building your first app&quot; adds too much gravitase and pressure to something that should be very small. More on this below.</p>
<p>Right now, I am clearly at the beginning of Stage 2. I need to build a very small thing. I&#39;ve just been struggling with what that thing should be and how to go about it.</p>
<p>I tried with the Responsive Nav Bar. That was 600-1000 lines of code in vanilla JavaScript. I couldn&#39;t understand a thing. </p>
<h2 id="decided-on-my-first-thing-">Decided on my first thing!</h2>
<p>On the recommendation of someone in the <a href="http://codebuddies.org">CodeBuddies Slack chat</a>, I went super small.</p>
<p>I actually looked up &quot;tiny tiny JavaScript projects&quot; and not a lot came up. Everything was sort of like the to-do list that we built in Watch &amp; Code. <a href="http://rmorabia.com/todo">As ugly as my to-do list is</a>, that&#39;s a full-page web application. That&#39;s complicated. No, thanks.</p>
<p>They suggested building a carousel. Huh! That&#39;s an option?</p>
<p>When they said that, it was like a lightbulb went off in my head. They gave me a basic list of components and I thought, &quot;Yeah... I can do that... maybe. Sort of!&quot; This is definitely something I can try to build instead of just being completely overwhelmed by how large even the smallest websites seem.</p>
<p>So now, I&#39;m committed to building <a href="https://codepo8.github.io/simple-carousel/carousel-simplest.html">this</a>.</p>
<p>There&#39;s a few tutorials out on the web for dead simple carousels. I plan to try and build it on my own and once I hit a wall, I&#39;ll consult a tutorial. I&#39;m not focused on following a tutorial completely to try and get the best, perfect carousel. I refuse to copy/paste. I will simply use a tutorial to debug and get ideas.</p>
<p>Disclaimer: I&#39;m not entirely committed to the idea of a carousel. This could change to an accordion or something else like that. It&#39;s not a huge deal about which tiny web component I&#39;m going to be making. The point is, my first thing I will build in JavaScript is going to be a tiny part of a website, not a full-blown website.</p>
<h2 id="tomorrow-s-to-do-s">Tomorrow&#39;s To-Do&#39;s</h2>
<p>Build the carousel! I&#39;m committed to this being a 1.5 day project.</p>
<p>Day 1: Work until exhaustion.
Day 2: Finishing touches/Deployment/Things I missed that a good night&#39;s sleep will help.</p>
<h3 id="there-are-still-a-few-half-finished-books-courses-that-i-ve-committed-to-finishing-that-i-d-like-to-list-here-for-reference-">There are still a few half-finished books &amp; courses that I&#39;ve committed to finishing that I&#39;d like to list here for reference.</h3>
<ul>
<li>Kyle Simpson&#39;s Introduction to JavaScript Programming (Video Course) - Short video course that corresponds to the first book in the YDKJS book series. It&#39;s supposed to be easier to comprehend than the book.</li>
<li>The Web Developer Bootcamp (Udemy Video Course) - 43 hours of video content, so far gone entirely untouched... It&#39;s giving me FOMO as I continue to wonder if it&#39;s the magic sauce I&#39;ve been missing this entire week. I just don&#39;t have a gut feeling that another video course is the right course of action right now.</li>
<li>CS50x - Newly re-recorded for 2018! <strong>Someday.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>I think that&#39;s it? Of course, there&#39;s a plethora of resources that everyone says I must read/finish — FreeCodeCamp lessons I tried and did not enjoy, Eloquent JavaScript which just seems hard and vague, You Don&#39;t Know JS which also seems hard and vague, and JavaScript: The Weird Parts which is also supposed to be my magic pill for the gap between Stage 1 and Stage 2.</p>
<p>Will I ever get around to them? I don&#39;t know. I don&#39;t know if I&#39;m that kind of person. Eventually, sure. But truly possibly on the nights and weekends after I&#39;m already getting paid to code.</p>
<p>See you tomorrow for another day of wandering &amp; whimsy!</p>
