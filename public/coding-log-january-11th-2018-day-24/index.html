      <p><strong>Coding Time:</strong> Full Day</p>
<p><strong>Here&#39;s what I did today:</strong></p>
<h2 id="started-freecodecamp-s-basic-javascript-track-http-freecodecamp-org-">Started <a href="http://freecodecamp.org">FreeCodeCamp&#39;s Basic JavaScript Track</a></h2>
<p>What&#39;s that? A few days off? Yeah. I took a bit of time off because I just didn&#39;t have a positive gut feeling about any of the books I chose. They focused too much on jQuery or their code examples were only enough to understand the concepts -- not to apply them to a real project.</p>
<p>So, I took some time to think through how to bridge this gap between knowing basic JavaScript concepts and syntax, and actually being able to do something with it. Well, the something I want to do is a FreeCodeCamp project anyway, right? Why not follow the FreeCodeCamp curriculum before that? It should theoretically prepare me for the Intermediate Frontend Projects.</p>
<p>At a minimum, it&#39;s an interactive coding environment that I can do at my own pace instead of falling behind watching videos.</p>

<h2 id="tomorrow-s-to-do-s">Tomorrow&#39;s To-Do&#39;s</h2>
<p>I could&#39;ve gotten further, but I&#39;m trying to adjust my sleep schedule to get more things done in the beginning of the day. I hope to come close to finishing this section tomorrow. The day after, I&#39;ll finish it up &amp; finish up the OOP/FP section as well. </p>
<p>Still keeping that Udemy course somewhere in the backburner here.</p>
