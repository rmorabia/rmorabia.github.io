      <p><strong>Coding Time:</strong> Half Day</p>
<p><strong>Here&#39;s what I did today:</strong></p>
<h2 id="started-learning-html-css-https-learn-shayhowe-com-html-css-">Started Learning <a href="https://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/">HTML/CSS</a></h2>
<p>I&#39;ve known HTML/CSS since I was 13. I learned by Googling what blocks I needed and filling the rest in along the way.</p>
<p>I didn&#39;t think I needed to read a book on the subject. This proves me wrong.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve learned a lot just today -- There&#39;s CSS resets so that your CSS can look as similar as possible along every web browser. There&#39;s CSS semantics to ensure that you&#39;re using the right elements for the right structure. The most mind-blowing fact? There&#39;s CSS IDs and Classes so you can apply CSS to something more specific than the entire element. I vaguely knew about this, but only with <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>s.</p>
<p>I&#39;m very excited to see where this book goes. We&#39;re building a website together in the book, which is a learning style I very much prefer. I like books that lead to an end project and walk you through it.</p>
<p>This book seems to focus on clean code right from the beginning. I took a lot of notes, but I wrote them on paper to just solidify them in head. I will be transcribing these onto the computer later, but for now, they sink in deeper on paper.</p>
<p>Today, I finished Sections 1 &amp; 2 out of 12. (This doesn&#39;t include the Advanced course. I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;m going to be taking that or not.)</p>
<h2 id="tomorrow-s-to-do-s">Tomorrow&#39;s To-Do&#39;s</h2>
<p>Finish sections 3-6 of the HTML/CSS course. If I finished 2 in a half day, I can surely finish 4 in a full day.</p>
