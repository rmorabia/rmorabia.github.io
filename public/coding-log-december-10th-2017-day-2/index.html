      <p><strong>Coding Time:</strong> 1 hour-ish</p>
<p><strong>Here&#39;s what I did today:</strong></p>
<h2 id="started-to-learn-the-command-line">Started to Learn the Command Line</h2>
<p>Today, I realized I have a problem with learning things I already know. I get extremely distracted and can lose myself for hours. To get to that flow state that keeps me working all night, I have to be working on something I don&#39;t know.</p>
<p>Does this mean I&#39;m going to lose book learning and switch to project-based learning? Not yet. In the case of building Kevin&#39;s site &amp; my site, I just took shortcuts. I don&#39;t know why anything worked. I just made sure it did. That doesn&#39;t seem smart for the long-term.</p>
<p>So, my middle ground is that I don&#39;t have to read through a book cover to cover. I hate the beginnings of books the most. In today&#39;s case, I already know what bash is, what ls is, what cd is. I can skim all the way to when I don&#39;t know something. Then, I focus on it.</p>
<p>Hopefully, this actually accomplishes something &amp; I&#39;m not just destined to never learn again.</p>
<h2 id="tomorrow-s-to-do-s">Tomorrow&#39;s To-Do&#39;s</h2>
<p>I&#39;m going to go through the command line book and actually finish it tomorrow. It&#39;s short enough that I really should get time to at least work through some of the Git book. I will skim through that, too.</p>
