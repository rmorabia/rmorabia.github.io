<p><strong>Here&#39;s what I did today:</strong></p>

<p>Feels good to have this done. I feel like I know the syntax of JavaScript now. I still don&#39;t have the knowledge to go out and use it in something real, though. The DOM parts of this course are what really separate it from other courses, I think. It&#39;s hard to wrap your brain around concepts when you&#39;re just having them do obscure/abstract math.</p>
<p>I really understood the first half extraordinarily well. We built the whole app in the console and there&#39;s a functioning to-do list that isn&#39;t connected to any sort of GUI. That&#39;s where the DOM stuff comes in, and then everything sort of scaled in the confusion and everything went a little too fast for me. I can read every line of my code... sort of. But, no way I&#39;d be able to rewrite that from scratch yet.</p>
<p>I&#39;m hoping a second go through of basic JavaScript concepts through the Bootcamp will help me out there. </p>
<p>This project is live at <a href="http://rmorabia.com/todo">rmorabia.com/todo</a>.</p>
<h2 id="made-some-small-changes-to-the-site">Made some small changes to the site</h2>
<p>...Or at least planned to. Transferred the DNS over to a more secure host. Designed the blog &amp; individual post pages that I&#39;ll need to screw around with in Jekyll tomorrow to get. Got a reference point for a new fancy vanilla JavaScript solution to a dropdown navbar on mobile.</p>
<p>I also decided I won&#39;t be moving forward with the Web Develoer bootcamp just yet. I&#39;m going to work on building stuff for a few days before I go straight into a long course again. First on that list, making my website&#39;s design the same all-around. I still hate being on Jekyll and wish I had the time to switch over to Hexo, but that&#39;s a weekend project for after I get a job.</p>
<p>So for now the site change checklist is as follows --</p>
<ol>
<li>Do not copy &amp; paste the source code for the nav bar, but write it yourself from the source code to integrate properly with the existing nav bar.</li>
<li>Clean up the file list in my current source code. Most of that code is from the theme, which I don&#39;t need anymore.</li>
<li>Make my index navbar &amp; footer layout pieces I can just copy paste.</li>
<li>Code the blog navigation page to have a short intro about my daily code log &amp; then the latest 10 posts. I really don&#39;t know how I specifically want to handle the design. I know I want divs between each post, but where should the date go? </li>
<li>Code the individual blog post page. This one&#39;s easy. Narrow-ish width, post, and then a footer very similar to the theme I chose right now. 2 lines of text (comments can be sent to my email, RSS feed link) and then &lt;- -&gt; arrows to lead to the previous and next post. I chose that theme for a reason. </li>
<li>Build a category page for monthly archives to link to in the blog navigation page.</li>
</ol>
<p>It <em>shouldn&#39;t</em> take more tha a focused day, but who ever knows how these things work.</p>
<h2 id="tomorrow-s-to-do-s">Tomorrow&#39;s To-Do&#39;s</h2>
<p>Finish the complete version 1 of my website. I have so many wonderful plans for where I want it to go in the future, but clean &amp; consistent design principles come first.</p>
