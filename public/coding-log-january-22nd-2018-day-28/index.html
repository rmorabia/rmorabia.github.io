      <p><strong>Coding Time:</strong> Full Day</p>
<p><strong>Here&#39;s what I did today:</strong></p>
<p>A whole week off, you say? Yeah. Things happen. ¯_(ツ)_/¯</p>

<p>In the meantime, I&#39;ve gotten pretty confident about the path through JavaScript. I had a good idea formulating when I last left off, and now I&#39;ve solidified it further. Instead of a dark tunnel between me and building the Advanced JavaScript Projects from FCC, I see a clear path that I just need to keep walking down. I just have to keep at it. </p>
<p>I don&#39;t know where to put this, but I want to acknowledge that the <a href="http://jsroadmap.com">JavaScript Roadmap Email Course</a> has been super helpful in making that path much more clear than just a list of what to do in order. </p>
<h2 id="-i-built-my-third-thing-http-rmorabia-com-tinyjs-"><a href="http://rmorabia.com/tinyjs">I Built My Third Thing</a></h2>
<p>I build Thing #3 today. It&#39;s very small. It just toggles the background color of the page. But, it&#39;s the first time I&#39;m applying the concepts of dynamic CSS to JavaScript. Now, I&#39;ve done a mini-project in programming logic/math, changing the HTML, and changing the CSS. Now, it&#39;s time to combine all 3 and build something a bit more real.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think I had the chance to mention that this is really good. I sort of regret not starting it earlier. It felt too easy, like a cop-out. I&#39;m now committed to working through this alongside building more in tinyjs along the way. I can&#39;t say for sure that it would&#39;ve been as useful as it is now without having tried JavaScript on my own first. I might&#39;ve just gotten lost in information overload.</p>
<p>Regardless, I&#39;m now committed to completing the entire JavaScript section of this course. That&#39;s about 10 hours. I&#39;m done with 2 hours so far. </p>
<p>Here&#39;s a complete map of the lessons I want to complete and how many I&#39;ve finished. </p>

</ul>
<p>I&#39;m skipping over HTML/CSS/Bootstrap because I know it, obviously. I&#39;m skipping over jQuery because I think it&#39;s going to help me cheat when I just want to learn how to do everything the hard way. Even though I claim to know the basics of JavaScript, I think it&#39;d be good to go back and do the 5 hours of basic JavaScript after I finish everything from DOM Manipulation forward. I thought I knew DOM manipulation, too. Turns out, I was wrong. </p>
<h2 id="i-almost-finished-my-fourth-thing-http-rmorabia-com-tinyjs-">I Almost Finished <a href="http://rmorabia.com/tinyjs">My Fourth Thing</a></h2>
<p>This is a mini-project from The Web Developer Bootcamp. It&#39;s supposed to be a code-along, but I thought I could tackle at least most of it myself, so I decided to give it a go.</p>
<p>It&#39;s a score keeper for games like rock-paper-scissors. It&#39;ll increase the score each time you press Player One or Two, and it&#39;ll show the winner by changing that player&#39;s score to green. There&#39;s a few other cool features like a reset button and the ability to change the score to declare a winner. </p>
<p>Here were the requirements for my code:</p>
<ol>
<li>When pressing Player One/Two, the respective number values should be increased by one.</li>
<li>Number limit should take the input and print it. </li>
<li>The value should stop going up when one player reaches the winning value. </li>
<li>When one player reaches the playingTo value, change the text color to green.</li>
<li>Reset button resets all values.</li>
<li>Number input reacts upon change, not just on click.</li>
</ol>
<p>I finished 4 of  those 6 requirements. #3: Button should stop going up and #6: Number input reacts on change, not just click are left.</p>
<p>I think I can still finish #3 on my own. Maybe. It&#39;s just programming logic, but it&#39;s difficult programming logic. </p>
<p>I have no clue how to do #6, but I think I might be able to figure it out by Googling details about event listeners.</p>
<h2 id="tomorrow-s-to-do-s">Tomorrow&#39;s To-Do&#39;s</h2>
<p>The point in the Web Developer Course that I got to is now mostly project-based. This means it might be a lot slower going than just the plain lessons. That&#39;s fine for now. Just keep moving forward, and if the projects get to be too much, go back to the basic JavaScript modules that I skipped.</p>
<p>Finish all the requirements for the score keeper app. Then, continue on to the next exercises and projects that the course puts forward. I&#39;m going to continue to try to at least attempt it on my own. </p>
