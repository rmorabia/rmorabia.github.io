<p><strong>Here&#39;s what I did today:</strong></p>
<h2 id="continued-learning-html-css-https-learn-shayhowe-com-html-css-">Continued Learning <a href="https://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/">HTML/CSS</a></h2>
<p>I finished Sections 9 &amp; 10 out of 12. If everything goes right tomorrow, I&#39;ll finally be done with this book!</p>
<p>Here are my notes for Sections 9 &amp; 10:</p>
<pre><code>## forms

* form wraps around input elements, like a section element
    * action (attribute) tells the website where to dump the info
    * method (attribute) tells the website how to dump the info
* specific form elements are (usually) `&lt;input&gt;`s
    * common type (attribute) are text
        * others include password, color, email, date, range, search, tel, url
    * name (attribute) names what the input is
* `&lt;input&gt;` for one line, `&lt;textarea&gt;` is for a paragraph
* submit button = `&lt;input type=&quot;submit&quot;&gt;`
    * alternatively, `&lt;button&gt;`
*  `&lt;input type=&quot;hidden&quot;&gt;` for hidden stuff like tracking codes
*  `&lt;input type=&quot;file&quot;&gt;` for file upload
*  form `&lt;label&gt;` can be inline or its own thing on top of an input
    * `for=&quot;input ID&quot;` (attribute, add the ID attribute yourself on the inpput)
* `&lt;fieldset&gt;` group relevant inputs together
    * `&lt;legend&gt;` tell users what this fieldset is supposed to do
* placeholder (attribute within input) for grayed out text inside form element
    * placeholder is grayed out while value puts the text in for the user
* required (attribute) won&#39;t submit form without an input
    * this will automatically validate if the type is correct (eg. email)

<p>I went up to Lesson 44 of 53. One more day for this book as well! </p>
<p>Here are my notes from today:</p>
<pre><code>* rebase v merge
    * rebase keeps the commits linear and doesn&#39;t show the merge, it pulls the commits from the other branch
    * merge has one commit, the merge commit
    * rebase for local stuff, merge for most public/work stuff
* `git clone [old repository] [new clone folder` to clone the folder and the files in it and the git instance itself 
     * will only clone the current branch
            * `git branch -a`(ll) will show all branches, including remote branches that are not cloned but in the remote repository
* `git fetch` will fetch new commits, will not merge the changes
    * to merge after fetching, do `git merge [remote repository branch]`

<p>First of all, on a sheer design note, I changed About to Skills. I just don&#39;t know what to put in About. Everything you need to know about me is in the first 2 lines of the website.</p>
<p>Anyway, today I accomplished the following:</p>
<h3 id="fully-completed-the-nav-bar-intro-sections">Fully completed the Nav Bar &amp; Intro sections</h3>
<p>The little things I left over from yesterday ended up being a lot. It took forever to find out how to make a nav bar sit on top of everything else and even longer to find a compromise on the button that goes to skills.</p>
<p>Adding the icons to the buttons in the intro was very easy, though. I also did quite a bit of designing to make the intro scaled and readable. </p>
<p>It&#39;s fully done. 2/7 fully done.</p>
<h3 id="99-fully-completed-the-skills-section">99% fully completed the Skills section</h3>
<p>I had to learn how grids work for this. It took a while to accept that I had to work within the confines of the framework. After I realized that, it took 15 minutes to fix this as I wanted. (Weirdly, the same process occurred for the down button in the intro section.)</p>
<p>It&#39;d seriously take an extra forever to do this without a framework. I still feel like I&#39;m cheating for using one since Spectre makes the bars, buttons, nav bar, and even cards for you. It&#39;s practically a copy, paste, and edit fest. Oh well.</p>
<h3 id="set-out-a-bare-framework-for-the-rest-of-the-site">Set out a bare framework for the rest of the site</h3>
<p>I just copy/pasted some elements to work off of for the next few days very quickly as my vision was blurring from working for so long.</p>
<h2 id="tomorrow-s-to-do-s">Tomorrow&#39;s To-Do&#39;s</h2>
<p>Read the last 2 lessons of the HTML/CSS book &amp; the last 10 lessons of the Git book.</p>
<p>For the website, here&#39;s what&#39;s left:</p>
<ul>
<li>Choose and add a font for the entire body</li>
<li>Edit the experience timeline (the writing in this is going to be much harder than the coding, I&#39;m telling you now)</li>
<li>Set up 6 Projects cards in a responsive grid</li>
<li>Finish the contact form, possibly adding a grid to have an aside that says &quot;I hate social media!&quot; </li>
<li>Create the footer</li>
</ul>
<p>Will I finish tomorrow? Probably not. Will I finish by the New Year? Maybe.</p>
