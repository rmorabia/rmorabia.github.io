      <p><strong>Coding Time:</strong> Full Day</p>
<p><strong>Here&#39;s what I did today:</strong></p>
<h2 id="finished-learning-the-command-line-https-ryanstutorials-net-linuxtutorial-">Finished Learning <a href="https://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial/">the Command Line</a></h2>
<p>Section 12 was on handling processes. Pretty useful, although I knew it all from frantic StackOverflow searches.</p>
<pre><code>* top is like task manager, view all processes
* ps (-aux for whole system) shows an alternative way of looking at processes including the PID
    * eg. ps aux | grep &#39;firefox&#39; to get the PID of firefox
* kill PID to stop a process
    * kill -9 PID to be AGGRESSIVE when plain doesn&#39;t work
* linux runs on multiple consoles (wtf?) and we&#39;re usually on 7.
    * you can access the other consoles by typing Ctrl + Alt + F(Console). this is useful when Console 7 locks up
    * sleep runs a program for a given number of seconds and then kills it
    * eg. sleep [number of seconds] (optional: &#39;&amp;&#39; to run sleep in the background)
    * **Ctrl + Z moves the current foreground process into the background for the terminal** (useful when git pushing?)
* fg brings background processes to the foreground
* jobs shows all the background jobs
</code></pre><p>Section 13 was on Bash scripting. I mostly skimmed through this as I haven&#39;t thought of a single thing that would be particularly useful to handle with a script. I may down the line, but not yet. Regardless, here are my notes:</p>
<pre><code>* save script as script.sh for easy finding
* start all scripts with #!/bin/bash
* just write whatever commands you would write manually in the command line, but then it does it automatically
* run by putting ./ in front of your script name. eg. ./myscript.sh
* variables:
    * syntax to set it up: name=&#39;Radhika&#39;
    * syntax to use it $name
    * eg. r=&#39;90&#39; $r
* use ` to represent the output of a command
* find finds files that fit certain arguments
</code></pre><p>It feels good to finally be finished with this, and to generally be finished with the first step on the path I&#39;m following. This took much longer than I anticipated, but I learned quite a bit. I&#39;m just glad to finally have free time for other books/courses.</p>
<h2 id="continued-cs50x-https-www-edx-org-course-introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x-">Continued <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x">CS50x</a></h2>
<p>I didn&#39;t get through the same problem I was stuck on yesterday. I was at it for hours, but I felt like I was missing something. Currently, I know exactly what I want the code to do, I just don&#39;t know how to make it do it.</p>
<p>This course is nice and all, but I don&#39;t think I can afford the time to sit through and do the deep university thinking. I have to learn to code. I can learn CS later.</p>
<p>I&#39;m going to finish Week 1&#39;s Problem Set and then put this on hold. At this pace, I don&#39;t know how long even that&#39;s going to take. I may visit it from time to time, but I&#39;m not doing it now. I will pick it back up once I&#39;m ready to apply for jobs. That way, I won&#39;t feel like I&#39;m wasting time.</p>
<p>There&#39;s this current problem I&#39;m halfway done with, and then one more problem (which may be even easier than this one according to some sources). Then, I&#39;m done.</p>
<h2 id="tomorrow-s-to-do-s">Tomorrow&#39;s To-Do&#39;s</h2>
<p>Start Shay Howe&#39;s <a href="https://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/">HTML/CSS course</a>. Woo! Onto semi-real coding.</p>
<p>Finish Week 1 of CS50x. I probably won&#39;t get it in even one more day, but I will try.</p>
