      <p><strong>Coding Time:</strong> 1 Hour</p>
<p><strong>Here&#39;s what I did today:</strong></p>
<h2 id="finished-building-my-todo-list-http-rmorabia-com-todo-">Finished Building my <a href="http://rmorabia.com/todo">Todo List</a></h2>
<p>I fixed the two bugs/features and pushed it out. It&#39;s done &amp; it&#39;s perfect. I had to ask for help again, though. </p>
<p>I&#39;m really down for some reason I can&#39;t put into words. For the first time in this entire journey, I really don&#39;t want to code. I don&#39;t want to quit, and I don&#39;t need a break, I just don&#39;t want to code.</p>
<p>So, even though I don&#39;t need a break, I&#39;m presumably taking a break. I don&#39;t know. Everything is muddled. There&#39;s a lot of mixed priorities. </p>
<h2 id="tomorrow-s-to-do-s">Tomorrow&#39;s To-Do&#39;s</h2>
<p>Anything, or nothing.</p>
<p>Remember when this was going to be the month where I finally had the ability to go full-time for real? Nope!</p>
