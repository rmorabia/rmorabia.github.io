<p>I finally finished this book! It took way longer than I thought it would, but I&#39;m glad it&#39;s done. I really enjoyed it, not only for the specifics of the technical content, but for teaching me about clean code and accessibility practices. It was also a really good testing ground for my learning methods going forward. I&#39;m going to be moving onto much more complicated stuff (JavaScript), and I can&#39;t afford to experiment with something that&#39;s fundamentally much more difficult. </p>
<p>Here are my notes for Sections 11 &amp; 12:</p>
<pre><code>## tables

* table `&lt;caption&gt;` is the way to title your table
* use colspan and rowspan to make a specific data point take up multiple spots
* css row separate will stack the borders from the cell and from the table on top of each other
* scope (attribute) row, col, colgroup, rowgroup to say where a header applies to

## clean code

* use comments LIBERALLY to organize code
* if the image doesn&#39;t need an alt text, include it and leave it blank
* use as few divs as possible
* use css IDs as little as possible
* in CSS, if the value is 0, write 0, not 0px/0%
* vender prefix: keep ABOVE the real elements

<p>I went up to Lesson 48 of 53. I really tried to finish this one today, but once I started, I felt my eyes burning. It&#39;s fine.</p>
<p>Here are my notes from today:</p>
<pre><code>* or just `git pull` to do both ^
* `git branch --track [local folder] [remote folder]` to create a new branch that tracks a remote branch
</code></pre><h2 id="tomorrow-s-to-do-s">Tomorrow&#39;s To-Do&#39;s</h2>
<p>I&#39;ll quickly wrap up the Git book in the morning. After that, this weekend is basically a mini-Hackathon to finish the site. </p>
<p>Here&#39;s what&#39;s left:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fix where the intro button links (negative margin)</li>
<li>Actively highlight the link in the menu if I&#39;m in that section </li>
<li>Choose a font!!</li>
<li>Complete the experience section</li>
<li>Complete &amp; grid-ify the projects section with 6 cards</li>
<li>Complete the Contact section</li>
<li>Complete the footer</li>
</ul>
<p>Will I finish it tomorrow? I don&#39;t know if a full day of focused work like that will help or hurt me. Regardless, I&#39;m pretty confident I&#39;ll finish it by Monday. After that, it&#39;s a tiny bit of Flexbox &amp; SASS, then I&#39;m off to learn JavaScript!</p>
