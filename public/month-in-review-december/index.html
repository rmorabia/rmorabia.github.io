      <h1>Month in Review: December</h1>
      <div class="meta">
          
      </div>
      <p>I just finished my first month learning to code! Happy new year, by the way.</p>
<p>This month, I spent <strong>15 of 31 days coding</strong>.</p>
<p>The approximate amount of hours I spent coding is <strong>95 hours</strong>.</p>
<p>That&#39;s definitely an underestimation of the amount of hours my butt was in the chair. I don&#39;t think I&#39;m effective enough at learning just yet to count every hour I spent in my chair as an hour coding. </p>
<p>My goal is to code for 1000 hours before I start applying for jobs. </p>
<p>At this rate, it&#39;ll take me <strong>9 more before I&#39;m ready</strong>. </p>
<p>Oof. Here&#39;s hoping I do better next month.</p>
<h2 id="what-i-wanted-to-accomplish-this-month">What I Wanted to Accomplish This Month</h2>
<p>I know I took it easy this month. A lot of my time was spent getting used to my new contacts, finalizing a learning plan, and most importantly, <strong>learning how to learn again</strong>. </p>
<p>These are very intangible goals that aren&#39;t related to coding, but that will help me out more in the long term. I made progress on all 3, but I&#39;m nowhere close to perfect yet.</p>
<p>On the actual coding front, though, here&#39;s what I wanted to accomplish:</p>
<ul>
<li>Build Kevin&#39;s Website</li>
<li>Build My Website</li>
<li>Learn the Command Line</li>
<li>Finish CS50x</li>
<li>Learn HTML/CSS</li>
<li>Build my portfolio (FCC Project)</li>
<li>Learn Git</li>
<li>Learn Flexbox</li>
<li>Learn Sass</li>
<li>(BONUS) Learn CSS Grid</li>
</ul>
<p>Here&#39;s how I actually fared on all of those goals:</p>
<h3 id="-build-kevin-s-website-http-kevinacarson-org-"><a href="http://kevinacarson.org">Build Kevin&#39;s Website</a></h3>
<p>I did it! It took an embarrassing amount of time to rebuild a website after years being away from static deployment, but I did it to make the next time easier. Nothing special here.</p>
<h3 id="-build-my-website-http-rmorabia-com-log-"><a href="http://rmorabia.com/log">Build My Website</a></h3>
<p>I wanted to get a website up as fast as possible so I could start my daily log. It took me a long time to finalize which static site generator would fit my needs. I ended up going with <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a>.</p>
<p>I didn&#39;t <em>want</em> to go with Jekyll. It&#39;s slow, and more than that, I just find Ruby to be a really awkward language to set up and work with. </p>
<p>But, I learned Jekyll in 2014. It has an <code>index.html</code> that just does whatever you ask it to. Every other static site generator had an <code>index.html</code> that was hard to find and customize. If I could change the <code>index.html</code>, I couldn&#39;t figure out a way to have a subdomain be my blog.</p>
<p>Jekyll just worked -- albeit after Ruby did the exact opposite of that. </p>
<p>I may change to Hugo/Hexo/Metalsmith down the line. For now, I just don&#39;t know enough about how they work.</p>
<h3 id="learn-the-command-line">Learn the Command Line</h3>
<p>This was my first real test in learning how to learn again. I had to choose between something accessible and something that went into detail. I went back and forth for days.</p>
<p>When I did finalize which <a href="https://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial/">guide I was going to follow</a>, I found it dense and hard to follow for more than a few lessons at a time. </p>
<p>This took forever. I started on <a href="http://rmorabia.com/2017/12/10/log">Day 2</a> and finished on <a href="http://rmorabia.com/2017/12/16/log">Day 7</a>. This was something that should&#39;ve taken a day... two at most. </p>
<p>That was probably the hardest thing I had to learn so far, for reasons entirely on my end.</p>
<h3 id="finish-cs50x-https-www-edx-org-course-introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x-">Finish <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x">CS50x</a></h3>
<p>I tried the first week. It seemed fun, but it seemed like it would take several hours I just couldn&#39;t afford right now. If I went through it, it would take me a solid month. That&#39;s a month I could be learning something directly useful, like JavaScript.</p>
<p>I will go through this eventually. I just don&#39;t have the time right now. For now, it&#39;s postponed.</p>
<h3 id="learn-html-css-http-learn-shayhowe-com-">Learn <a href="http://learn.shayhowe.com">HTML/CSS</a></h3>
<p>This was the next major thing to learn after the Command Line. This also took forever, but for different reasons than the Command Line.</p>
<p>This book was legitimately long (just wait until you get to the JavaScript books, Radhika!) and I was really solidifying my learning practices.</p>
<p>I ended up with a process I hope to emulate in all the future books give me enough space to do so.</p>
<p>There were basically two sections per chapter. One was the reading/learning section. The other was the &quot;In Practice&quot; session where we sit at the computer and learn to code.</p>
<p>I&#39;m REALLY bad at reading on the computer. I don&#39;t know if I&#39;ll get better over time or if I&#39;m just doomed forever. I don&#39;t know if I can actually become a good programmer if I&#39;m doomed forever. I just can&#39;t handle reading long, techical texts on a backlit screen.</p>
<p>So, I got the book on Kindle. I would sit in bed and read the first sections on my Kindle, taking notes on paper.</p>
<p>Then, once we got to &quot;In Practice,&quot; I would move to the computer and go through that there. I would also transcribe the notes. </p>
<p>I&#39;d go back and forth every day.</p>
<p>I also ran into problems with giving myself the task of &quot;Get through as much of the book as you can in one day.&quot; It led to me getting through less than one section per day.</p>
<p>So, I went off of my progress for the first day and just set the goal for 2 sections per day. The entire book had 12. </p>
<p>This wasn&#39;t the most ambitious goal I could&#39;ve set, but it was definitely attainable and possible. I reached it almost every day, no matter what time I started and what time I ended. The consistency paid off a lot more than possibly binging 4 sections a day instead of 2. </p>
<p>Overall, this took me 6 days to read through.</p>
<h3 id="-build-my-portfolio-http-rmorabia-com-fcc-project-"><a href="http://rmorabia.com">Build My Portfolio</a> (FCC Project)</h3>
<p>This was really cool! By the end of the HTML/CSS book, I was itching to code again. I had designed my website a few times before, but it&#39;d always been very simple. Of course, when I designed them, I thought they were the most difficult things in the world.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/build-a-personal-portfolio-webpage">This challenge was from FreeCodeCamp.</a> It has a few requirements and has an example website for you to base your website on.</p>
<p>I based my website on the standards set by FCC &amp; <a href="bmorelli25.github.io/portfolio-template/">this portfolio template</a>.</p>
<p>Extra challenge? Make it mobile-responsive, accessibility-friendly, AND have readable code.</p>
<p>Somehow, I did it all within the span of 2 days. There was a lot of Googling, a lot of copy/pasting random answers from StackOverflow just to see if something would stick. </p>
<p>But, I got it done faster than expected and it includes a lot of complicated elements I&#39;m very proud of.</p>
<ul>
<li>The intro is both horizantally and vertically aligned to whatever your screen size is.</li>
<li>The button in the intro that links to the Skills doesn&#39;t seem that special, but man, that was a lot of work.</li>
<li>Both the skills and the project sections are extra mobile-responsive, changing the grid layout depending on what the width of your screen is.</li>
</ul>
<p>I will continue to make small iterations on the website as I learn more and more.</p>
<h3 id="learn-git-http-gitimmersion-com-">Learn <a href="http://gitimmersion.com">Git</a></h3>
<p>Easy peasy. I&#39;ve been using Git &amp; GitHub since 2014. I went through a book to solidify it and learned a few new things. I did it on the side with extra time I had after reading the HTML/CSS book. </p>
<h3 id="learn-flexbox-http-flexbox-io-">Learn <a href="http://flexbox.io">Flexbox</a></h3>
<p>This was my first video course! It was decent. I still haven&#39;t decided if I like books or video courses better. </p>
<p>I haven&#39;t had much chance to practice Flexbox. I hope to just master it as I go.</p>
<h3 id="learn-sass-http-sass-lang-com-guide-">Learn <a href="http://sass-lang.com/guide">Sass</a></h3>
<p>First, I had to learn that it&#39;s &quot;Sass,&quot; not &quot;SASS.&quot; I sound like an old person yelling, &quot;GET ME ON THE FACEBOOK.&quot;</p>
<h3 id="bonus-learn-css-grid-https-scrimba-com-g-gr8pte-">BONUS: Learn <a href="https://scrimba.com/g/gR8PTE">CSS Grid</a></h3>
<p>I technically could&#39;ve fit this one in, but I was really squeezing too much grid learning in during the last few days. I was afraid I&#39;d just get them confused if I learned them right next to each other, so for now, learning CSS grid is postponed.</p>
<p><strong>How many goals did I accomplish this month? 8/9, and I didn&#39;t complete the bonus</strong></p>
<p>Not bad for my first month! I feel pretty good about this, but it is the easiest month of them all. </p>
<p>Next month, I&#39;ll begin learning JavaScript.</p>
<h2 id="early-estimates-for-january">Early Estimates for January</h2>
<p>Without really knowing enough to judge how long this will take, this is how much I&#39;d get through in an ideal world:</p>
<ul>
<li>You Don&#39;t Know JS: Up &amp; Going</li>
<li>You Don&#39;t Know JS: Scope &amp; Closures</li>
<li>You Don&#39;t Know JS: this &amp; Object Prototypes</li>
<li>You Don&#39;t Know JS: Types and Grammar</li>
<li>Project: FCC Algorithm Challenges (Basic)</li>
<li>BONUS: DOM Manipulation</li>
<li>Project: Make a todo list webapp</li>
</ul>
<p>Will I get through all this? I have no idea.</p>
<p>Tune in next month, and every day in the meantime, to find out.</p>
