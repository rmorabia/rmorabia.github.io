      <p><strong>Coding Time:</strong> Full Day</p>
<p><strong>Here&#39;s what I did today:</strong></p>
<h2 id="-submitted-that-article-to-reddit-https-www-reddit-com-r-learnprogramming-comments-7yyb7g-6_tiny_project_ideas_to_go_from_i_know_the_basics-"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/7yyb7g/6_tiny_project_ideas_to_go_from_i_know_the_basics/">Submitted that article to reddit</a></h2>
<p>Gimme that viral fame, internetz! </p>
<p>Again, there&#39;s no real benefit to me writing that, and I hope I never try to write something like that again. There&#39;s no point. Stick to code, girl.</p>
<h2 id="made-a-small-change-to-the-index-http-rmorabia-com-">Made a small change to <a href="http://rmorabia.com">the index</a></h2>
<p>It turns out that the sliding bars that I had before might not be the best way to present my skills. It&#39;s pretty, but it&#39;s vague.</p>
<p>If you&#39;re reading this, go to <a href="http://rmorabia.com">rmorabia.com</a> and tell me what you think about my change. I think it looks very bare now, but I feel like there&#39;s little I can do to spruce it up. The colors are already my attempt to make it fancy.</p>
<p>I thought about different charts, but I think they&#39;d all show me in a bad light. I think the only alternative is still displaying the skills in a linear fashion like that, but just with a bit more pizzazz. </p>
<h2 id="-learned-more-about-higher-order-functions-array-map-etc-https-www-youtube-com-watch-v-kwoz9_eczxq-"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWoZ9_ECZxQ">Learned more about higher-order functions, array.map, etc..</a></h2>
<p>Higher-order functions are kind of like closures in that they&#39;re fancy versions of normal functions. But, higher order functions either take a function as a parameter or return a function. So, that&#39;s cool? I don&#39;t understand the usage except in existing higher-order functions, but the more you know.</p>
<p><code>Array.map()</code> is a glorified for/forEach loop. Which... okay... I at least know how it works now. The only difference is that it only works if it returns </p>
<p>So, the problem from JavaScript30 is as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Array.prototype.map()</p>
<ol>
<li>Give us an array of the inventors&#39; first and last names</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>So, the code is pretty simple. </p>
<pre><code class="lang-js">let map = inventors.map(function (inventors) { 
    return inventors.first + &#39; &#39; + inventors.last
})

console.log(map)
</code></pre>
<p>The only part I&#39;m kinda confused about is why it needs the parameter? But, it&#39;s still just a case of understanding the syntax.</p>
<p>We also learned about <code>Array.filter</code>, but I just really can&#39;t see a use for this right now. I&#39;m going to watch the video on filter &amp; sort tomorrow, as well, but other than the JS30 exercises, I can&#39;t see how this is useful in real projects. </p>
<p>By the way! I linked to a new resource today. This is The Coding Train on YouTube. There&#39;s actually some good tutorials on YouTube. </p>
<p>This is a really cool channel. It&#39;s very teacher-like. I feel like I&#39;m in a classroom with a very animated and very good teacher again. The only problem is that since it&#39;s teacher-like, many of the videos are just to explore programming art and physics. It&#39;s not directly applicable.</p>
<p>But, for topics I really don&#39;t understand, if Dan&#39;s already done a video on it (which he probably has), it&#39;s a great way to spend a few hours and let it really sink in. </p>
<p>Any other YouTube channels I can recommend? Right now, just <a href="http://youtube.com/funfunfunction">FunFunFunction</a>. That&#39;s about it. </p>
<p>I really need a minimum energy level in a video to stay engaged. </p>
<h2 id="tomorrow-s-to-do-s">Tomorrow&#39;s To-Do&#39;s</h2>
<p>Really didn&#39;t accomplish much today considering the amount of hours my butt was in this chair. I just felt too floaty today to really focus on code.</p>
<p>Watch the 2nd livestream from The Coding Train which covers the other Array methods.</p>
<p>Continue going through JS30 &amp; JS: The Weird Parts. </p>
