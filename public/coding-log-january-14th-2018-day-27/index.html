      <p><strong>Coding Time:</strong> Full Day</p>
<p><strong>Here&#39;s what I did today:</strong></p>
<p>Wow. We&#39;re already halfway through January. At this point, I expected to be at least starting to go through Basic Algorithms on FreeCodeCamp. This is clearly going to take at least a week longer to get to that point.</p>
<p>Granted -- I haven&#39;t tried even the first lesson in the Basic Algorithms section. Maybe it&#39;s time? </p>
<h2 id="-i-built-my-second-thing-http-rmorabia-com-tinyjs-"><a href="http://rmorabia.com/tinyjs">I Built My Second Thing</a></h2>
<p>I build Thing #2 today. Despite the complexity, it was easier than yesterday. I ran into just one problem, which was a problem I had the day before. I forgot to do <code>bankBalanceInput.value</code> and instead just told JavaScript to bring the ENTIRE <code>bankBalanceInput</code>!</p>
<p>The application follows the logic of the practice exercise in YDKJS. The logic is very easy to break, but there is logic. </p>
<p>Here were the app requirements: </p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/master/up%20%26%20going/ch1.md#practice">Follow the requirements/steps for the console version of the app as listed in YDKJS.</a></li>
<li>Create inputs for bankBalance and spendingThreshold.</li>
<li>Display total &amp; if the user can afford the purchase.</li>
</ul>
<p>I got stuck between Requirement 2 and Requirement 3. I was a little ambitious and coded both at once instead of testing one at a time with the console. I got lucky that it was a smaller app this time, but I have to remmeber to take it slower.</p>
<p>Also, I used a bit more MDN today! It just still doesn&#39;t seem to be the best for quick referencing.</p>
<p>Tomorrow&#39;s idea is building something in the DOM that&#39;ll manipualte CSS!</p>
<p>I&#39;m not sure if I should continue focusing on DOM manipulation or JavaScript programs that are more logic-based. I think I&#39;m too much of a beginner to know. I think just having displayable projects is what&#39;ll keep me motivated. </p>
<h2 id="continued-watching-the-web-developer-bootcamp">Continued watching The Web Developer Bootcamp</h2>
<p>I skipped ahead to the DOM Manipulation section. This skips over HTML/CSS/Bootstrap &amp; Basic JS. I may go back and watch the Basic JS sections because I need more familiarity with the concepts. But, only if I get extra time.</p>
<h2 id="tomorrow-s-to-do-s">Tomorrow&#39;s To-Do&#39;s</h2>
<p>I&#39;m switching tactics again and I&#39;m going to start Basic Algorithms on FCC. I&#39;m pretty anxious as just the word Basic Algorithms feels pretty advanced. I&#39;m worried that there&#39;s a gap in my knowledge that FCC&#39;s earlier Basic JavaScript and Object Oriented Programming cover, but I&#39;ll only know when I try.</p>
<p>If I&#39;m lucky, these are displayable challenges I can continue to add to my tiny JS (in the DOM!) projects. </p>
<h3 id="just-to-reiterate-what-i-feel-behind-on-">Just to reiterate what I feel behind on...</h3>
<ul>
<li>I still have to finish my website. There&#39;s a lot of small changes and some big changes that I need to do, but it&#39;s just too easy to worry about the website and not worry about actual coding.</li>
<li>YDKJS Video Course #1</li>
<li>Web Dev Bootcamp Pre-DOM Manipulation Sections</li>
<li>Basic JavaScript &amp; OOP sections of FCC</li>
<li>Actually getting to the point where I make a real small app!</li>
</ul>
<p>The courses are probably all the same concepts, just presented in different ways. I won&#39;t feel that way until I successfully push past into creating real apps.</p>
