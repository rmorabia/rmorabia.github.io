      <p><strong>Coding Time:</strong> Full Day</p>
<p>It&#39;s been a whole week since I last updated! I didn&#39;t really do anything worth mentioning in the interim. As long as I keep showing up, I will eventually get to where I want to go.</p>
<p><strong>Here&#39;s what I did today:</strong></p>
<h2 id="continued-learning-html-css-https-learn-shayhowe-com-html-css-">Continued Learning <a href="https://learn.shayhowe.com/html-css/">HTML/CSS</a></h2>
<p>I finished Sections 5 &amp; 6 out of 12. I definitely handled this better than I would&#39;ve last week. Section 6 is twice as long as Section 5, and I&#39;m pleasantly surprised I read them both in one day.</p>
<p>I did so by going back and forth between my computer and my Kindle. This book has definite &quot;reading&quot; sections and definite &quot;practice&quot; sessions. If it&#39;s reading/absorbing time, I grab my notebook + fountain pen and saunder off into my bed with my Kindle. Once it&#39;s practice time, it&#39;s back on my computer.</p>
<p>I definitely absorb more from my Kindle, but I obviously can&#39;t practice on it. At the same time, if I&#39;m sitting in bed too long, I start to fall asleep. This is a good balance between relaxed absorption and short, focused practice sessions. I hope I can replicate it for the books to come.</p>
<p>Back to the course, though...</p>
<p><a href="https://learn.shayhowe.com/practice/working-with-typography/index.html">The website we&#39;re making is turning out to be gorgeous.</a> (Not going to upload my source code if only because it&#39;s 90% similar to the working examples on the book&#39;s web site.)</p>
<p>I didn&#39;t know you could do all of this with plain CSS (+ some CSS grid for mobile-responsiveness?). I definitely don&#39;t have the design chops to think this up, regardless of the technical code behind this website. You really don&#39;t know what you don&#39;t know. This book is written with design in mind &amp; it shows.</p>
<p>It&#39;s nice to know that I have this arsenal of inline-block, box-models, and semantics to fall back on when I end up designing something complicated. This book is showing the sheer possibility of design within CSS. It may be overkill for job readiness in the short-term, but I&#39;m really enjoying it.</p>
<p>Here are my notes for Sections 5 &amp; 6:</p>
<pre><code>## css columns

* **this is all not mobile responsive, as far as i can tell**
* float: left or right will move an element to the side and the other elements will flow around it
  * eg. img { float: right; } 
    * if you want to do more than left &amp; right (2 columns), position all to the left and adjust the width
    * use margin &amp; width with float to column properly
* what happens when content overlaps and bleeds through?
    * clear: both can be used AFTER floats to prevent the following elements from using the space in between.
        * can be left, right, or both. preference both.
    * OR contain floats by creating a parent element that only allows wrapping within it. 
        * eg. 
                ```.group:before,
                    .group:after {
                      content: &quot;&quot;;
                      display: table;
                    }
                    .group:after {
                      clear: both;
                    }
                    .group {
                  clear: both;
                  (* zoom: 1;
                    }
                    section {
                      float: left;
                      margin: 0 1.5%;
                      width: 63%;
                    }
                    aside {
                      float: right;
                      margin: 0 1.5%;
                      width: 30%;
                    }
</code></pre><ul>
<li>use inline-block + relevant width &amp; other elements to model columns and layouts as well.<ul>
<li>no need to clear floats, BUT a space will be created between the blocks which can be fixed in the HTML by starting the next section on the same line. eg. <head> </head><aside></aside><ul>
<li>this can also be fixed by commenting on the space between the lines</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>position will make an element go to a specific place rather than a column<ul>
<li>relative works with the flow of the page, the position it relative to itself</li>
<li>absolute is relative to the parent element and does not take into account the flow of the page</li>
<li>use box-offset (direction) to define the position from ^</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="typography">typography</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>these are all pretty common and easily searchable</strong></li>
<li>to center text vertically within an element (like a button), set height and line-height to the same value<ul>
<li>eg. .btn { height: 22px; line-height: 22px; }</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>text-indent: get that fancy newspaper look</li>
<li>text-shadow: exists to look like you&#39;re stuck in 2005? could look cool for a:hover</li>
<li>there are only some web-save fonts: including arial, garamond, courier, times, etc.. very limited, but good for fall-back.<ul>
<li>the ultimate fall-back is serif or sans-serif, though</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>@font-face: use any font file you locally have or sourced from another place like google fonts
```</li>
</ul>
<p>Quite a bit of it is not in proper syntax since Markdown recognizes HTML and thinks I actually want to bold or italicize my notes. I know what the proper syntax is for these, I just had to write them in a readable way for the notes.</p>

<p>I went up to Lesson 23 of 53 before getting too mentally exhausted to understand anything. I&#39;m still trying to progress through this in short bursts, I don&#39;t mind how many days it takes.</p>
<p>Here are my notes from today:</p>
<pre><code>* `git tag` -- checkpoints to easily refer to. [tag] can be used instead of hash
* how to revert back to master when already git add-ed? `git reset HEAD file.name` (to get rid of the add) + `git checkout file.name`
* how to revert back when already git commit-ed? `git commit HEAD` to revert to last commit, `git revert [hash]` to revert to any previous commit
    * extra: want to erase that this ever happened? `git reset --hard [hash/tag]`
* `git commit --amend -m &#39;message&#39;` to fix that stupid mistake without making a whole new commit
* aliases:
    * `git co` = checkout
    * `git c` = commit
    * `git st` = status
    * `git hist` = pretty log
* `git mv` to move locally and let git know in the process, no need for git add afterwards
* `.git/config` will overwrite git settings for this project
