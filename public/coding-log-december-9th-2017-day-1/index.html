      <p>Normally, this line would be a time tracker. I haven&#39;t installed one yet. I will soon. I&#39;m still adjusting to Ubuntu.</p>
<p>Anyway, <strong>here&#39;s what I did today:</strong></p>
<h2 id="built-this-website-">Built this website!</h2>
<p>After finishing <a href="http://kevinacarson.org">Kevin&#39;s website</a>, I decided it was time to put my own up. I&#39;ve had a vague idea of what I wanted to do with it for a while.</p>
<p>As of right now, the plan is to have a static homepage that describes who I am and what I do. Maybe it&#39;ll link to some projects down the line.</p>
<p>Within that, though, I&#39;ll have a daily code log. I&#39;m going to try to make some sort of coding progress every day. That can be direct coding, reading something, or just making my development environment better. All the code I write will be posted here &amp; on GitHub.</p>
<p>If I ever solve something through an absurd amount of Googling, I will probably write a tutorial on it. If I write enough of these, I&#39;ll have a new tutorials category for the blog and link that separately from the coding log.</p>
<p>I moved around between <a href="http://hexo.io">Hexo</a>, <a href="http://gohugo.io">Hugo</a>, and <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> for days. As a future JavaScript expert, I&#39;d prefer to work with a JavaScript generator. When I downloaded Hexo and initiated my site, I found the layout completely foreign. Making custom pages (especially a custom homepage) seemed nearly impossible. It might just be my lack of familiarity.</p>
<p>I then tried Hugo since that&#39;s what I built Kevin&#39;s website in. Completely foreign, again. So, I gave in and installed Jekyll. I had custom built my website in 2014 using Jekyll, so it couldn&#39;t be that foreign. It really wasn&#39;t. There&#39;s a lot of quirks to Jekyll that are very annoying and have caused a lot of people to move to Hugo, but for now, I don&#39;t care. I apparently don&#39;t know enough about code to know how to change an <code>index.html</code> without completely destroying a site.</p>
<p>In Jekyll, the <code>index.html</code> is right in the root, and the variables(?) are written in a much more human way than with Hugo or Hexo. I may export to Hexo down the line, but for now, this is working.</p>
<p>Jekyll does, however, have one major catch. <strong>Ruby is a nightmare on Ubuntu.</strong> It&#39;s much harder to install properly than either Go or Node.js. There are people who say otherwise, but I doubt they&#39;re brand new to the language. I had major issues with installing Ruby, Jekyll, and Bundler. <code>jekyll serve</code> was completely broken at multiple points.</p>
<p>I ran multiple reinstalls, followed all the StackOverflow advice, and finally Googled this fateful term: &quot;Why is Ruby so hard on Ubuntu?&quot; That led to a StackOverflow answer that linked to <a href="http://ryanbigg.com/2014/10/ubuntu-ruby-ruby-install-chruby-and-you">this blog post</a>. I followed each step completely. Everything works perfectly. It&#39;s almost magical.</p>
<p>Now, both the front-end and the back-end of my site are set-up and presumably futureproof.</p>
<h2 id="learned-markdown-">Learned Markdown.</h2>
<p>I was already pretty familiar with Markdown from regular usage on GitHub, reddit, and my blog. I&#39;m going to be using it a lot more from now on, though, so I thought it&#39;d be prudent to formally learn it. I took a 30-minute course called <a href="http://masteringmarkdown.com">Mastering Markdown</a>. It&#39;s pretty good. I just got bored during it. I don&#39;t know if video courses are for me, still. I think I&#39;m more of a &quot;learn it when you need it&quot; type of person.</p>
<p>Regardless, I learned a few new tricks that will hopefully prove useful.</p>
<h2 id="tomorrow-s-to-do-s">Tomorrow&#39;s To-Do&#39;s</h2>
<p>I&#39;m going to be taking another course from the same creator of the Markdown course. This time, it&#39;s about the Command Line. I&#39;m once again not sure I need it, but I think it&#39;s worth formalizing. After that, I&#39;m going to try to get through a Git book or two. I want to get very familiar with the workflows for my future projects as a solo developer and in the workplace.</p>
<p>If I still have time, I&#39;ll be learning HTML &amp; CSS again. Just the basics. I&#39;ll learn the advanced stuff as I need it.</p>
