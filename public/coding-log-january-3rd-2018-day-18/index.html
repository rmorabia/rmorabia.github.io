<p><strong>Here&#39;s what I did today:</strong></p>
<h2 id="switched-up-tactics-">Switched Up Tactics!</h2>
<p>After reading Up &amp; Going (the introductory book from the You Don&#39;t Know JS series that introduces programming concepts in the context of JavaScript), I think it&#39;s time to stop. I don&#39;t know when I&#39;m going to pick it back up, but I need to change tactics.</p>
<p>Last year, I made a goal to read every Shakespeare play. I was going to read the play first and then listen to a lecture about it after.</p>
<p><strong>I did it wrong.</strong></p>
<p>I felt this weird echoing of that as I was reading all of these JavaScript concepts. Then I remembered, learning concepts without knowing how they&#39;re actually useful is as good as memorization. It&#39;s useless. I&#39;m glad I read this book #1, but I can&#39;t continue with book #2 until I know how to use all of this.</p>
<p>This is not the right book for me. I don&#39;t know how beginners go through with and actually go on to building stuff. I know vanilla JavaScript is important and I am going to do it, but I am going to go through a beginner&#39;s course for beginners.</p>
<p>What does this mean and what am I going to do?</p>
<p>First of all, I&#39;m going to try and watch Kyle Simpson&#39;s <a href="https://frontendmasters.com/courses/javascript-basics/">3 hour course</a> that&#39;s basically a video version of the book I just read. He has 8 courses on Frontend Masters, and 6 seem to correspond quite heavily with the 6 books in the series. This is to just solidify the concepts again.</p>
<p>If it&#39;s as dense and unapplicable as the book is for me right now, I will skip it.</p>
<p>Second of all, I&#39;m going to go through <a href="https://watchandcode.com">Watch and Code</a>. It&#39;s basically zero to functioning to-do list app. I&#39;ve heard nothing but great things about it. It seems to be very practical. </p>
<p>That should take me a few more days.</p>
<p>After that? I don&#39;t know. I don&#39;t think I should jump back into YDKJS yet. I just don&#39;t know. I&#39;m considering either following FreeCodeCamp to a tee with some complementary Mozilla Developer Network documentation or following <a href="https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp/">The Web Developer Bootcamp by Colt Steele</a>. I have to decide within 8 days because the Udemy course is on sale for $10.99 right now, which is basically the lowest it&#39;s ever been.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t know. I can&#39;t force things when I obviously don&#39;t understand them. I even feel like I don&#39;t really know CSS now, since I can&#39;t build something mobile-responsive without using a Framework. I want to go back and learn animations and CSS grid and actually build a website from <em>real</em> scratch, but I just feel like I don&#39;t have time right now.</p>
<h2 id="continued-learning-javascript-https-github-com-getify-you-dont-know-js-">Continued Learning <a href="https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS">JavaScript</a></h2>
<p>I read through most of Chapter 2 of Up &amp; Going. See above? None of this matters. It feels like a waste of time to bang your head against the wall when I could come back to this in a month and understand it much better after actually having <em>used</em> it.</p>
<h2 id="started-watch-code-http-watchandcode-com-">Started <a href="http://watchandcode.com">Watch &amp; Code</a></h2>
<p>I got through about 25% before I had to stop myself to re-evaluate my entire plan for how I was going to move forward. I could&#39;ve done more, but it was so good that it made me rethink everything I thought about learning to program. I understood it so easily. It&#39;s so much simpler, and more than that, clearer than You Don&#39;t Know JS. This is not a slight on YDKJS, but this is a slight on everyone who says it&#39;s a good introductory book. No. </p>
<p>It doesn&#39;t have to be as hard as these difficult books make it seem.</p>
<p>W&amp;C ends with making a fully-fledged to-do list. I think I&#39;ll finish the course within the next 2-3 days if I go at it full-time. I&#39;m excited to actually build something.</p>
<p>It&#39;s reminiscent of the HTML &amp; CSS book which I really enjoyed. Learn new concepts each lesson with the context of how it&#39;ll fit into the website/app we&#39;re building at the same time. I really love it. I&#39;m surprised by how much I love it.</p>
<p>It&#39;s too late for me to really be coherent about this. I&#39;ll write more about why I love it tomorrow.</p>
