      <p><strong>Coding Time:</strong> Full Day</p>
<p><strong>Here&#39;s what I did today:</strong></p>
<h2 id="finished-learning-git-http-gitimmersion-com-">Finished <a href="http://gitimmersion.com">Learning Git</a></h2>
<p>I quickly finished the last few chapters. I&#39;m glad to be done with that. I think I already had a good understanding of Git since I&#39;ve been using it for years now, but the book introduced me to some workflows that I hadn&#39;t thought of as a single contributor who mostly just uses GitHub.</p>
<h2 id="finished-my-portfolio-page-https-www-freecodecamp-org-challenges-build-a-personal-portfolio-webpage-">Finished <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/build-a-personal-portfolio-webpage">My Portfolio Page</a></h2>
<p>Wow, I finished it in one day. Including the two other half-days I spent on it, <strong>this website basically took me 2 days to finish</strong>. I even re-read the code before deploying it to make sure it was readable.</p>
<p>I&#39;m not sure if I should write a blog post about my decisions and problems in making the website, or if a demo and a source code is enough project proof.</p>
<p>As a quick summary for my future self, the biggest struggle was everything relating to the button link in the intro that goes to skills. I struggled with centering it, having it be an icon that is a link, and having it link to the proper spot that wouldn&#39;t cover up the Skills headline. </p>
<p>I may write a complete project write-up tomorrow. I&#39;m not sure. For now, I&#39;m just glad to be done.</p>
<h2 id="tomorrow-s-to-do-s">Tomorrow&#39;s To-Do&#39;s</h2>
<p>I wanted to read the SASS guide &amp; watch the Flexbox videos in the time I still had after finishing my website, but my wifi went down, so I suppose it was the universe telling me I deserve a break.</p>
<p>Tomorrow is the last day of December! It&#39;s also hopefully the last day I work on HTML &amp; CSS. I have to read the SASS guide and get through as much of the Flexbox course as I can. I don&#39;t know how long it is, so I&#39;m not sure I can finish it in one day. If I can&#39;t, my CSS studies will overflow into the time I allocated for JavaScript. Oh well.</p>
<p>I&#39;ll also be writing a Month in Review tomorrow.</p>
