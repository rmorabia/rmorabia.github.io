      <p><strong>Coding Time:</strong> 5 hours-ish</p>
<p><strong>Here&#39;s what I did today:</strong></p>
<h2 id="continued-to-learn-the-command-line">Continued to Learn the Command Line</h2>
<p>Sometimes, a resource doesn&#39;t click with you. Sometimes, <em>two resources in a row</em> don&#39;t click with you. I finally zeroed in on <a href="https://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial/manual.php">Ryan&#39;s Tutorials</a>. I&#39;m about halfway done with it. I will finish tomorrow.</p>
<p>I expect this will be a problem in the future, but hopefully not to the same extent. I have a few lists of curated resources I&#39;m following. I plan to pull all my future learning from there. None had any courses on the CLI, which I knew I wanted to master, so that&#39;s why this is taking so long.</p>
<h2 id="tomorrow-s-to-do-s">Tomorrow&#39;s To-Do&#39;s</h2>
<p>I will finish the command line. I may start on Git.</p>
