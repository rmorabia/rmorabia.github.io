<p><strong>Here&#39;s what I did today:</strong></p>
<h2 id="-continued-to-learn-the-command-line-https-ryanstutorials-net-linuxtutorial-"><a href="https://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial/">Continued to Learn the Command Line</a></h2>
<p>I really don&#39;t want to turn into a book learner. I don&#39;t believe you need to go through a book 100% to get going, get started, and get to making real things. Making things teaches you a lot more than just going through a book and doing examples. The further I get into this book, the more I feel like I should skim faster and faster.</p>
<p>So today, I skimmed through <strong>Section 10: Grep and Regular Expressions</strong>. I can see where this becomes useful in debugging large files, sometime down the line. However, I won&#39;t be debugging in the command line. I&#39;ll be debugging in my text editor of choice. (Currently, that&#39;s Atom, but I really haven&#39;t decided.) I have one line of notes from this:</p>
<pre><code>* egrep is the command for regular expressions, which can help you find data that matches a particular pattern
</code></pre><p>If Grep is relevant within my IDE/text editor, I&#39;ll learn it within the confines of that particular editor. It&#39;s probably more graphical and has specific quirks.</p>
<p>Next up? <strong>Section 11: Piping and Redirection.</strong></p>
<p>Here are my notes from the very useful section:</p>
<pre><code>* [command] &gt; [location] will save a log of the output from that command
    * &#39;&gt;&gt;&#39; to add the output to an existing file instead of &gt; replacing it
    * use 2 (stream 2: error stream) to write errors to log. eg. ls video.mpg 2&gt; errors.txt
        * to do both, &amp;1. eg. ls -l video.mpeg vi3 &gt; myoutput 2&gt;&amp;1
* &lt; to redirect FROM a file, eg. wc -l &lt; myoutput
    * still not sure how this is useful but whatever
* piping | splice multiple programs together. the output from the first command is the input for the second program. it can run forever. eg. ls | head -2
</code></pre><p>There are only 2.5 sections left. I expect to finish this within a day or two.</p>

<p>Today, I started on Week 1 of the course. I think I&#39;m sticking with this course instead of any other course. It&#39;s hard enough for a video course to hold my attention. The production quality and the general enthusiasm the professor has for really making things simple have kept me moderately captivated.</p>
<p>I watched the lecture for Week 1 today, which 2 hours and 10 minutes long. It was dense. I feel the muscles in my thighs going numb from sitting still for so long. It covered a lot in one day, without breaks for implementation. This covers my fundamental problem with university-style learning &amp;/or video learning at large. I wanted to stop when David covered &quot;Hello world&quot; in C. I wanted to pause and try that code for myself. Before I could, he moved onto math. Then, he moved onto real-world problems with binary overflow. I couldn&#39;t stop at all. Technically, I could&#39;ve because it&#39;s an online video with the Pause button, but I didn&#39;t feel like there was any proper stopping point.</p>
<p>It&#39;s a really interesting introduction to <em>Computer Science</em>, though. It&#39;s not just about code, it&#39;s about understanding why the code works that should serve as a fundamental block for any area of coding that the student would later go into. I think I&#39;ll invest a bit more time into it even though it feels slightly wasteful because of the broad application.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t think the lectures exist to help with the coding, though. This course is way more like iterative project learning with supplemental videos rather than videos with supplemental Problem Sets/homework. I don&#39;t know if I&#39;m a fan of that or not. I like the really dumbed down way of exploring CS <em>concepts</em> in the lectures, though. I don&#39;t know how useful it&#39;ll be in my future. Will it stick with me and fundamentally change my ideas about computers &amp; coding? I don&#39;t know, but I like it.</p>
<p>We are supposed to code all of our projects in the online IDE C9, which I&#39;m not sure I&#39;m a fan of. It&#39;s slower than working in Atom/any local IDE. My computer &amp; my wifi aren&#39;t very fast, so that extra RAM/bandwidth being eaten by working in another computer in the browser isn&#39;t the most ideal situation. It&#39;s also not the best way to develop independent coding skills. Regardless, I don&#39;t want to cause problems between the automatic grading system and my local code, so I&#39;ll learn C9.</p>
<p>This week, we began to learn C. The problem set this week is 4 (already?!) small C projects that build incrementally on top of each other. Here is my source code for each one:</p>
<p><em>Spent 2.5 hours on these first two projects tonight</em></p>
<p><strong>Hello, World!</strong> (Source provided by the course, our job was simply to run it in the IDE)</p>
<pre><code class="lang-c">#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main(void)
{
    printf(&quot;hello, world\n&quot;);
}
</code></pre>
<p><strong>How many bottles of water do you user per minute in the shower?</strong></p>
<p>Typical liberal college projects focusing on environmentalism. I found that funny. This was the first self-coded project. I felt completely lost. I already forgot all of the syntax in C. I went back into the lecture just see an example of how the syntax in C actually works. I also needed the hint (in the walkthrough) of which function I&#39;m supposed to use.</p>
<p>Once I got the first half (input minutes), the rest came easily. I checked every new line by re-compiling and running the program to make sure it still worked to the specifications I wanted. The int names aren&#39;t as intuitive as I would like, but I didn&#39;t want to waste time going back and making them perfect.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-c">#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;cs50.h&gt;

int main(void)
{
    printf(&quot;How many minutes did you shower? &quot;);
    int n = get_int();
    printf(&quot;Minutes: %i\n&quot;, n);

    int b = n * 12;
    printf(&quot;Bottles: %i\n&quot;, b);
}
</code></pre>
<p>That&#39;s all I finished today. There are two more left. Here&#39;s where I left off with the third exercise — building a virtual staircase based on the integer provided by the user. I&#39;m still not even finished with actually making sure the user inputs the correct integer to render the staircases. I have to browse through the lecture &amp; the corresponding videos to find the missing links in my brain tomorrow.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-c">#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;cs50.h&gt;

int main(void)
{    printf(&quot;Height: &quot;);
    int h = get_int();
    if (h &lt; 23)
    {
        printf(&quot;%i\n&quot;, h);
    }
    else
    while (true)
    {
        printf(&quot;Height: &quot;);
        int g = get_int();
        printf(&quot;%i\n&quot;, g);
    }

}
</code></pre>
<h2 id="tomorrow-s-to-do-s">Tomorrow&#39;s To-Do&#39;s</h2>
<p>Finish Week 1 of CS50x. Optionally, conquer both the less comfortable &amp; the more comfortable versions of each exercise. It may make Week 2 and so on easier.</p>
<p><em>Optional:</em> Upload all of my source code from the CS50 project into a public GitHub folder called CS50? As long as I publish it here, I can choose to do this at a later point. I&#39;m not sure how useful this will be, or if it&#39;s good only for the sake of completion.</p>
<p>Complete Section 12 of the command line guide.</p>
<p>Still got time? Finish the rest of the CLI guide. </p>
