      <p><strong>Coding Time:</strong> Half Day</p>
<p><strong>Here&#39;s what I did today:</strong></p>
<h2 id="rewrote-the-entire-plan-again">Rewrote the Entire Plan Again</h2>
<p>I know I&#39;m near the end of my JavaScript basics phase. I&#39;ll go through a few more projects and I&#39;ll write a few more components for tinyjs, and that&#39;s it. I can actually build things in JavaScript.</p>
<p>So, now that I&#39;m nearly done with the hardest part of JavaScript -- the part where most people never get past, I had to start thinking about efficiently tackling the next part. I needed to map out how I planned to get good at intermediate JavaScript concepts.</p>
<p>As I did so, I realized that the timeline may run a bit long. JavaScript is hard and I want to get a really good footing on it. Here&#39;s the rest of the plan for JavaScript:</p>
<h3 id="the-rest-of-january">The Rest of January</h3>
<ol>
<li>Finish the front-end section of The Web Developer Bootcamp (3 projects + 5 hours of JavaScript basics)</li>
<li>Build 6 components/mini-projects in tinyJS (2 done, 4 left -- those 4 left may overlap witht he 3 projects in the Web Developer Bootcamp)</li>
<li>Read YDKJS: Up &amp; Going (Again? Yes, again.)</li>
<li>Read YDKJS: Scope &amp; Closures</li>
</ol>
<p>This may bleed into February depending on how long the projects take.</p>
<h3 id="february">February</h3>
<ol>
<li>JavaScript30 (one video a day)</li>
<li>FreeCodeCamp&#39;s Intermediate Front-End Projects</li>
<li>FreeCodeCamp&#39;s sections on Object-Oriented &amp; Functional Programming and on JSON APIs &amp; AJAX</li>
<li>Udacity&#39;s AJAX courses (Intro to AJAX, JavaScript Promises, and Asynchronous Requests)</li>
<li>JavaScript: Understanding the Weird Parts</li>
<li>FreeCodeCamp&#39;s Advanced Front-End Projects</li>
<li>BONUS: ES6 for Everyone - Wes Bos</li>
<li>BONUS: Udacity&#39;s Object-Oriented Programming</li>
<li>My Pet Project in JavaScript!!!</li>
</ol>
<p>This month is a lot more ambitious. I can definitely handle JS30, all the projects (intermediate, advanced, and my pet project), and FCC&#39;s introductions to AJAX/API/OOP/FP. Depending on the rigor of JS: Understanding the Weird Parts and Udacity&#39;s AJAX courses, those may bleed into March. I really doubt I can finish the bonus courses next month. It&#39;s a lot to fit in. </p>
<p>I may end up making JavaScript a 3-month affair rather than 2 months. We&#39;ll see.</p>
<p>Of course, as I continue, the list may end up being trimmed like it was for January. Maybe FCC covers enough for me, or I only need small sections of the courses instead of the whole thing. There&#39;s a lot of potential for overlap here, which I like.</p>
<p>After that, React, Node, SQL/Algorithms/maybe-not-even-SQL-and-just-learning-MongoDB/both??? Again, every step makes the next step more clear than before.</p>
<h2 id="-built-thing-5-http-rmorabia-com-tinyjs-"><a href="http://rmorabia.com/tinyjs">Built Thing #5</a></h2>
<p>First use of random &amp; animations. Not a huge deal, just a little test. </p>
<h2 id="tomorrow-s-to-do-s">Tomorrow&#39;s To-Do&#39;s</h2>
<p>I got really sidetracked by setting up my new Chromebook. I hope this will up my productivity in the days to come. </p>
