      <p><strong>Coding Time:</strong> Half Day</p>
<p><strong>Here&#39;s what I did today:</strong></p>
<h2 id="started-building-thing-6-http-rmorabia-com-color-game-">Started Building <a href="http://rmorabia.com/color-game">Thing #6</a></h2>
<p>I decided to take a pretty huge leap and go from building small components in tinyjs to a full-page app that deserves its own Github repository.</p>
<p>This project is a code-along from <a href="http://udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp">The Web Developer Bootcamp</a>, but I&#39;m choosing to tackle it all on my own.</p>
<p>The end result should look something like <a href="https://codepen.io/DanBonehill/full/VejYRz">this</a>.</p>
<p>It feels so big. It took me a few days to even reach the point where I was comfortable writing down the requirements for the project. They&#39;re not very clear, but here they are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Generate an RGB color randomly and convert it into text form.</li>
<li>Convert that text form into a block of color.</li>
<li>Display 6 random blocks of color.</li>
<li>One of those 6 is the same color as the top text form of that color.</li>
<li>That spot always changes to a random one of the 6.</li>
<li>Click on a color that doesn&#39;t match: color block turns black</li>
<li>Click on the right color: All 6 + background turn to that color</li>
<li>Difficulty toggle: Easy has 3 blocks, Hard has 6</li>
<li>When choosing the wrong anwer, a try again message appears</li>
<li>Site is mobile-responsive</li>
</ol>
<p>The core functionality is only in the first 7 requirements. After that, it&#39;s just styling. I can focus on that later. </p>
<p>I got requirements 1 &amp; 2 fairly easily. However, when it came to displaying 6 random blocks of color, I knew I could do it randomly with 6 different functions that all align to 6 different element IDs. But, that just isn&#39;t clean and it won&#39;t work with the later portions of the requirements. </p>
<p>I think I need to start with requirement #3. I need to somehow use arrays or objects to have one function apply to 6 different things. I don&#39;t really know enough about arrays and objects to do this, so this is a great excuse to actually go back and review the JS Basics part of the bootcamp!</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>I got to the point where it displays 6 random colors and there&#39;s a string output of one of the colors of the 6. This means I mainly just have all the clicking logic left. </p>
<ol>
<li>Click on a color that doesn&#39;t match: that one turns black</li>
<li>Click on one that does match: all 6 colors go to that color</li>
</ol>
<p>&amp; then the styling/different modes. Meh on that part.</p>
<p>I think the hard part is done, and I can hopefully easily do the rest tomorrow. I set down a good foundation today that I can build on tomorrow. </p>

<p>I went back and rushed through Intro to JavaScript, then skipped forward to the sections on Arrays &amp; Objects.</p>
<p>I didn&#39;t get very far until I remembered all I needed to about Arrays, so I didn&#39;t even fully finish the first video of that section. Oh well. </p>
<h2 id="tomorrow-s-to-do-s">Tomorrow&#39;s To-Do&#39;s</h2>
<p>Finish the Color Game Project!</p>
