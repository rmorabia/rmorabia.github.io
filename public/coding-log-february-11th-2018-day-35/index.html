      <p><strong>Coding Time:</strong> Full Day</p>
<p><strong>Here&#39;s what I did today:</strong></p>
<h2 id="learned-about-scope-closures">Learned about Scope &amp; Closures</h2>
<p>I have a list of topics that I wanted to learn. It&#39;s not really clear how they&#39;re useful just yet.</p>
<p>I was anxious about reading an entire book on the topic (YDKJS). Can&#39;t I just get the TL;DR? It seems like overkill when I&#39;m still building really simple apps.</p>
<p>I decided to just read some articles and watch some YouTube videos for this. I hope it&#39;s enough. It already feels too advanced for the code I&#39;m writing right now, but I&#39;m at least familiar with the concept now.</p>
<p>I have no specific recommendations for what the best articles/videos were. They were all either too basic or too advanced. If you want to learn about it, just read everything you can. I guess the best recommendation would&#39;ve just been to read the book. But I just really didn&#39;t want to.</p>
<p>On my specific journey through Scope &amp; Closures these past 2 days, I also learned a bit more about some ways to respond to the DOM.</p>
<p>One example of this, something I want to try out asap, <code>querySelector</code> is more static and <code>getElementsBy</code> is more dynamic. It&#39;s something to test.</p>
<p>I also realized I need to learn about callback functions. I don&#39;t know what that word means at all.</p>
<p>But here&#39;s what I did learn about scope &amp; closures:</p>
<p>Scope is the area in which your variables are valid.</p>
<p>Variables defined inside of a function are only applicable within the function.</p>
<p>Variables defined outside of a function are still capable inside or outside of a function.</p>
<p>When there&#39;s a function inside of a function, that&#39;s called a closure. It has the scope of its parent function. The parent function does not have scope inside of the child function, except if a statement in the function is to return a variable.</p>
<p>This scope of the parent function does not apply when you call a child function instead of defining it within it.</p>
<p>I get it, I think? I don&#39;t know. I can&#39;t really think of much more to say than this. It just seems like, &quot;Okay, cool. That happened.&quot;</p>
<p>Be concious of run order and how variables can be misused and mutated into things that you didn&#39;t think would happen. I mean, okay. I&#39;ll organize my code a bit differently now. Cool?</p>
<h2 id="tomorrow-s-to-do-s">Tomorrow&#39;s To-Do&#39;s</h2>
<p>Start JavaScript30!</p>
<p>Maybe start reading about AJAX/APIs? Maybe some about callback functions? Maybe some other stuff this theory-heavy internet deep dive leads me on?</p>
