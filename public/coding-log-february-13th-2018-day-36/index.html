      <p><strong>Coding Time:</strong> Half Day</p>
<p><strong>Here&#39;s what I did today:</strong></p>
<h2 id="started-javascript30-http-javascript30-com-day-1">Started <a href="http://javascript30.com">JavaScript30</a> Day 1</h2>
<p>This took a lot longer than I expected. Day 1 just happened to be all of the things I&#39;ve never done before.</p>
<p>The app only has two requirements (and the CSS/HTML is already pre-built):</p>
<ol>
<li>When the user presses the correct letter on the keyboard, play a short animation on the corresponding box.</li>
<li>When the user presses the correct letter on the keyboard, play the corresponding sound.</li>
</ol>
<p>That&#39;s not so hard, right! Well, I&#39;ve never had a user play a sound, trigger an animation, or checked for the correct key being pressed.</p>
<p>So, today I figured out how to get the right key. I figured out how to trigger the animation, too.</p>
<p>What&#39;s left is playing the sound and turning the animation off when the sound is pressed.</p>
<h2 id="tomorrow-s-to-do-s">Tomorrow&#39;s To-Do&#39;s</h2>
<p>Continue with JavaScript30.</p>
<p>My new &amp; updated list of things I need to do before I finish with vanilla JavaScript is as follows:</p>
<p>Courses/Linear Things:</p>
<ol>
<li>JavaScript30</li>
<li>JavaScript: The Weird Parts</li>
<li>Intro to AJAX on Udacity</li>
<li>JavaScript Design Patterns on Udacity</li>
</ol>
<p>Things to Read/Watch Videos About:</p>
<ol>
<li>ES6</li>
<li>Object-Oriented Programming</li>
<li>Functional Programming</li>
</ol>
<p>And of course, we shouldn&#39;t forget building projects along the way. Although, I&#39;m pretty sure for as long as I&#39;m doing JS30, the difficulty of the first one suggests that this is all the appetite I have for projects.</p>
