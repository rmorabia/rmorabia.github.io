      <p><strong>Coding Time:</strong> Full Day</p>
<p><strong>Here&#39;s what I did today:</strong></p>
<h2 id="submitted-my-first-pull-request-https-github-com-codebuddies-codebuddies-pull-798-">Submitted my <a href="https://github.com/codebuddies/codebuddies/pull/798">first Pull Request</a></h2>
<p>This was just a quickie for <a href="http://codebuddies.org">CodeBuddies</a>, which is the main platform I hang out on. It just involves some really small CSS changes. Easy enough.</p>
<p>Still took me a few hours since the site is run on Meteor and I don&#39;t understand how Meteor works. I&#39;ve also never really run around a large Git repository like that. I messed up my first commit, so I just reverted it and pretended it never happened, but Git knows... Git always knows...</p>
<p>This was good practice, though. I want to have a section on my website like <a href="http://rmorabia.com/#projects">Projects</a> that lists out my Open Source contributions before I get to interviews.</p>
<p>&quot;Not only have I built my own silly apps, I have contributed to other people&#39;s less silly apps!&quot;</p>
<h2 id="finished-day-4-of-javascript30-http-github-com-rmorabia-javascript30-">Finished Day 4 of <a href="http://github.com/rmorabia/JavaScript30">JavaScript30</a></h2>
<p>Well, this sure ramped the difficulty up.</p>
<p>This was my first exposure to array methods. </p>
<p>They seem pretty hard. I just need a few exercises to solidify the syntax and use cases. My head hurts, I feel tired, this was a case of learning overload.</p>
<p>I believe all of the basic algorithm exercises on FreeCodeCamp are based on these. So, I&#39;ll probably get a chance to get better soon enough. </p>
<h2 id="continued-watching-javascript-understanding-the-weird-parts-https-www-udemy-com-understand-javascript-">Continued Watching <a href="https://www.udemy.com/understand-javascript/">JavaScript: Understanding the Weird Parts</a></h2>
<p>I watched like... one video? This wasn&#39;t my best day.</p>
<h2 id="wrote-an-article">Wrote an Article</h2>
<p>I guess old habits die hard. I&#39;m not going to link it because I plan on publishing it, but I wrote an article called &quot;How to Go From Knowing the Basics of JavaScript To Actually Building Websites.&quot;</p>
<p>The basic concept is just putting <a href="http://rmorabia.com/tinyjs">tinyjs</a> into words.</p>
<p>It&#39;s around 1000 words and I spent hours editing it today. Why? Who knows? </p>
<p>I don&#39;t know why I waste my time like this. CODE!!!</p>
<p>I&#39;m going to go through a sleep-on-it edit and then try to submit it to FreeCodeCamp. Wish me luck, I guess?</p>
<h2 id="tomorrow-s-to-do-s">Tomorrow&#39;s To-Do&#39;s</h2>
<p>Continue going through JS30 &amp; JS: Understanding The Weird Parts.</p>
<p>Maybe get something real done for once?</p>
