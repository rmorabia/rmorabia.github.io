      <p><strong>Coding Time:</strong> Full Day</p>
<p><strong>Here&#39;s what I did today:</strong></p>
<h2 id="worked-on-rmorabia-com">Worked on Rmorabia.com</h2>
<p>I have now made the entire site have a similar look &amp; feel. Goodbye, Jekyll themes! Hello, custom design!</p>
<p>Everything <em>should</em> be working with these choice exceptions:</p>
<ol>
<li>My JavaScript responsive nav isn&#39;t happening just yet. I tried reading the code for it and it was like reading German.</li>
<li>Footer is high on pages where the content doesn&#39;t at least fit the screen. Haven&#39;t found a fix for this yet. I don&#39;t know if I ever will.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="tomorrow-s-to-do-s">Tomorrow&#39;s To-Do&#39;s</h2>
<p>So, going to spend a few minutes on the footer (and full disclosure, I may just give up) and then...</p>
<p>I have to find a book to continue with for JavaScript! Watch and Code was excellent for introducing concepts. However, for applying those concepts, I really need to go at my own speed. This is book speed. So, I&#39;m going to spend all day browsing through books to try and see if any are based on building tiny projects, one after another.</p>
